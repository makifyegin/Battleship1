# Battleship1

Battleship (also called Battleships or Sea Battle) is a two-player strategy game whose history traces back to the First World War. 
It started off as a pencil and paper game, until Milton Bradley coined the rules and published the game. 
Fun fact: it was one of the first games to be produced as a computer game in 1979!  First off, brush up on the rules of the game. 
There are different variations of the Battleship game, but I will stick to the original rules written by Milton Bradley.
You have a 10Ã—10 game field and five ships to arrange on that field. The ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but not diagonally 
across the grid spaces; the ships should not cross or touch each other. The goal is to sink all the ships of the opponent before your opponent 
does this to you.Positioning the ships is exactly where we are going to start! The goal of this first stage is to place all the ships on the game 
field according to the rules.
